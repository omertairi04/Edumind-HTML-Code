                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                    <li>Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Decorate the cake:
                <ol>
                    <li>Once the cakes are completely cool, spread a layer of buttercream frosting over the top of one cake layer.</li>
                    <li>Place the second layer on top and frost the top and sides of the entire cake.</li>
                    <li>Decorate with sprinkles, piped frosting, or any desired toppings.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Slice the cake into even pieces and serve.</li>
