            <h1>Pizza history</h1>
            <p>
                Pizza is one of the most beloved dishes worldwide, known for its versatility and irresistible combination of flavors. Originating from Italy, it typically consists of a round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and a variety of other ingredients, such as meats, vegetables, and herbs, then baked at a high temperature.

            The classic Margherita, named after Queen Margherita of Savoy, is a simple yet iconic variety topped with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil, representing the colors of the Italian flag. Beyond traditional Italian styles, pizza has evolved into countless regional adaptations. From the deep-dish, cheese-stuffed pies of Chicago to the thin, crispy crusts of New York-style pizza, thereâ€™s something to satisfy every palate.

Whether enjoyed fresh out of a wood-fired oven, as a quick takeaway, or a frozen delight at home, pizza continues to bring people together as a universally loved comfort food.
